HOUSE TO HOUSE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM (H-HEAS) is a project developed by a high school student as an innovative solution for enhancing emergency communication within communities. Recognizing the need for a fast and efficient way to request help during emergencies, this system enables households to send real-time distress signals to a monitoring base, which then provides immediate alerts and responses.

The project utilizes WebSockets to establish instant communication between users and responders, ensuring that emergency messages are received without delay. Designed with accessibility and simplicity in mind, H-HEAS allows users to trigger an alert with a single button press, making it especially useful for elderly individuals, people with disabilities, or those in urgent need of assistance.

This initiative showcases the potential of technology in community-driven safety and highlights the capability of young innovators in tackling real-world problems.
